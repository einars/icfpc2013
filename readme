ICFPC-2013. Raging mushrooms team

This is the OCaml (and web/php scoreboard) part of out code.
The Lisp solver might (or might not) be found somewhere else.

This is probably quite useless for you or anyone else: all the cool stuff is in
the commit history (or even lost between the commits): the #master branch shows
only the latest experiment (a fairly reasonably working genetic approach).

The raging mushrooms of 2013 were Edmunds Cers, Arturs Grebstelis and Einar Lielmanis.
